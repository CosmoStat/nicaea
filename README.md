### Version

### Download, compile, and run nicaea

#### Download the code

Clone the code from the github repository,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmoStat/nicaea
```

A new directory `nicaea` is created automatically. Create a build directory, and configure the code as follows.
You can specify the installation path with the option to cmake `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH`.

```bash
cd nicaea
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH
```

On success, compile install the code:

```bash
make
[sudo] make install
```

The last command will copy the executable demo programs (e.g. lensingdemo)
to `PATH`/bin, the library libnicaea.a to `PATH`/lib, and the include
files to `PATH`/include/nicaea . If you did not specify the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH` above, the default
location is used, in which case you might need to prepend `sudo` to the `make` command,
to get write access to the system-wide installation directory.

If the necessary libraries are found on the system, the python module
pynicaea is also installed.

The code can be tested with::
```sh
ctest -vv
```
To run the demo programs, go to `nicaea_2.7/par_files`.
